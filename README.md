# BBGame114 Arduino Library

The BBGame114Lib.zip library for Arduino included in this repository is a library that allows the BBGame114 device to be programmed with higher level methods/functions than the Arduino `digitalWrite` and `digitalRead` functions. See the page [BBGame114Lib Library Reference](https://github.com/mtejada11/BBGame114/wiki/BBGame114Lib-Library-Reference) page for more information on this library.
